ExpressOS
=========

ExpressOS is a high assurance OS architecture that enforces high level
security invariants to improve the security of mobile application,
where the enforcement has been formally verified.

ExpressOS is able to run non-trivial, unmodified Android application
like web browsers. Thanks to its novel architecture, and automatic
verification techiques including Dafny and code contracts, the
verification effort on security invariants is low enough to be
pragmatically feasible.

The ASPLOS'13 paper contains more technical information of the design
and implementaiton of ExpressOS.

This repository holds the kernel of ExpressOS. The project also holds
the instructions of building and using ExpressOS.
